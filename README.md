# AISystemLegalCaseSolving

This repository presents an AI system that is able to semi-automatically solve legal cases. That is, in collaboration with a user.

The system was created by Iris Kamsteeg as a Bachelor's project at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. The project was supervised by prof. dr. Verheij.

The system was based of HASL/2 by Van der Linde (https://github.com/jelmervdl/moriarty). The following files were modified:

hasl2/diagram.py
